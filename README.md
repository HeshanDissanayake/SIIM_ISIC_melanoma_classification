# Melanoma classification

### problem description

Skin cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer. Melanoma, specifically, is responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths, despite being the least common skin cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates over 100,000 new melanoma cases will be diagnosed in 2020. It's also expected that almost 7,000 people will die from the disease. As with other cancers, early and accurate detection—potentially aided by data science—can make treatment more effective.

### Used methods

* Convolutional neural nerwork.
* Convolutional Auto Encoder.
* Transfer learning.(EfficientNetB5).

### Some results
#### Auto encoder results.

In the following image it show the results that was generated trough the Auto encoder. This auto encode was tested to reduce the dimentionality by generating a latent space.
